    question: 'Tell me a little bit about yourself?',
    response: 'I come from a background in marketing where I operated brand and email campaigns of over 1.8 million contacts. During my time at Fullbeauty Brands, there was a lot of cross collaboration with the marketing and web development teams. I was interested in the design and development of the company’s websites and daily emails. I met an employee on the web dev team who graduated from General Assembly’s WDI bootcamp. I am in the process of building my career as a Web Developer, and just finished working on several projects. I am excited to join the Tech industry and work in a team of talented developers.'

    question: 'What excites you about technology?',
    response: 'What excites me the most about technology is its constant advancement and change. The technology we know today will be even more robust within a year or two. Technology is always improving in such a way that it brings more convenience or more features to users. One area in technology that interests me the most is augmented reality. As human beings, we rely a lot of senses. When we interact with a virtual reality that intertwines with our world, it brings a very exciting experience, either by sight or sound.'

    question: 'What is your preferred technology stack?',
    response: 'I prefer Rails in terms of creating the server routes quickly. However, Express is a fast growing and highly demanded techstack. Express offers more flexibility, while Rails is a very opinionated framework. Furthermore, which tech stack I prefer depends on the needs of the project and the desires of the client.'
